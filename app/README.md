# This is a dummy app

## Point

I wanted to write something I could use to test out architecture deployments, without having to worry about other variables at the moment.

## Sourcing

The work is initially based on the nginx-wsgi-flask subproject of https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose/

## Future work

* I'm wanting to allow it to read/react to environment variables, and other facilities to check connections... 
* I also would like to make it deployable within AWS container service, which will be the next stage.

## Current utility

* Two containers communicating and responding.
